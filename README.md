create an API (Django, flask, Django Rest API or fast API) which takes the inputs A and B.
The API will produce an output with sum, division, multiplication and subtraction of the output in a json format
Entire output can be stored in a database with the relevant data types
It would be great if it tracks the source of the input like IP address, time of the request, request process time
